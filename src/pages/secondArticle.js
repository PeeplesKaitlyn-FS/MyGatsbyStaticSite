      <h1>Deploying a React App to Multiple Platforms</h1>
      <p>
        In this article, we'll explore the process of deploying a React app to multiple platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Deploy to Multiple Platforms?</h2>
      <p>
        Deploying to multiple platforms allows you to reach a wider audience and provide a more seamless user experience across different devices and operating systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Web Deployment</h2>
      <p>
        Deploying a React app to the web is a straightforward process. You can use a service like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS to host your app.
      </p>

      <h2>Mobile Deployment</h2>
      <p>
        To deploy a React app to mobile devices, you can use a framework like React Native. This allows you to build native mobile apps for both iOS and Android.
      </p>

      <h2>Desktop Deployment</h2>
      <p>
        To deploy a React app to desktop devices, you can use a framework like Electron. This allows you to build cross-platform desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
      </p>

      <h2>Using a Single Codebase</h2>
      <p>
        One of the benefits of using React is that you can use a single codebase to deploy to multiple platforms. This means you can share code between your web, mobile, and desktop apps.
